```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/march_madness.git
cd march_madness
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3. **Set up environment**
```bash
# Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed
python --version
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Data Processing
```python
# Process historical tournament data
from funcs.data import process_years
process_years("data", "processed_data", 2021, 2023, 
              AP6=True, bart_a=True, # ... feature flags)
```

### 2. Run Tournament Simulation
```python
from funcs.ml import simulate_brackets
model, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, team_key, test_case, avg_score, max_score = 
    simulate_brackets(input_directory="processed_data", year=2025, n=25)
```

### 3. Generate Predictions
```python
from funcs.sims import simulate_probs
df = simulate_probs("processed_data", "output", 2025, sims=1000, n=100)
```

## Model Features

The project includes several sophisticated features for basketball analytics:

### Statistical Features
- **AP6**: Associated Press Top 25 rankings
- **BART**: Barthag power rating
- **Conference Strength**: Conference performance metrics
- **KenPom Ratings**: Advanced efficiency metrics
- **Seed Performance**: Historical seed-based analysis
- **Team Rankings**: Multiple ranking system integrations

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Bracket Scoring**: Traditional tournament scoring (10-20-40-80-160-320 points)
- **Accuracy**: Game prediction accuracy
- **Confusion Matrix**: Classification performance visualization

## Results & Performance

The system provides comprehensive analysis including:
- Average bracket scores across multiple simulations
- Upset prediction capabilities
- Round-by-round performance analysis
- Champion and Final Four probability distributions

### Sample Output
```
Brackets Simulated: 25
Average Upsets: 2.52
Average Bracket Score: 126.44
Average Bracket Round Scores: [29, 26, 14, 12, 23, 20]
Max Bracket Score: 155
```

## ðŸ”¬ Advanced Features

### Tournament Bracket Structure
The system models the complete 64-team tournament structure:
- **Round of 64**: First round 
- **Round of 32**: Second round
- **Sweet 16**: Regional semifinals
- **Elite 8**: Regional finals
- **Final Four**: National semifinals
- **Championship**: National final

### Sweet 16 Specialization
Specialized modeling for teams that advance deep in the tournament, recognizing that different factors become important in later rounds.

## Usage Examples

### Create Tournament Predictions
```python
# Generate probability matrix for all possible matchups
YEAR = 2025
sims = 1000
df = simulate_probs("processed_data", "output", YEAR, sims, n=100)
print(df.sort_values(by=["SEED"], ascending=True))
```

### Simulate Single Bracket
```python
# Simulate one complete bracket
from funcs.sims import simulate_bracket
bracket_result = simulate_bracket(2025, "processed_data")
```

### Compare Model to Baseline
```python
# Compare different model approaches
teams, ml_preds = tourney_sim_test(test_case, X_test, model, team_key)
teams, seed_preds = tourney_sim_baseline(test_case, X_test, team_key)
teams, perfect_preds = tourney_sim_perfect(test_case, X_test, team_key)
```

## Testing & Validation

The project includes comprehensive testing infrastructure:
- Historical tournament validation (2021-2024)
- Cross-validation across multiple years
- Performance comparison against baseline methods

## Data Sources

The project processes various basketball statistics including:
- Game-by-game results
- Team efficiency metrics
- Player statistics and ratings
- Conference strength indicators
- Historical tournament performance

*"The beauty of March Madness lies in its unpredictability, but with data and machine learning, we can better understand the madness."*
